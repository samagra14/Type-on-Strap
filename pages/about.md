Hi there! Thanks for stopping by!

My name is Samagra.(It's nice to meet you!) I am an undergrad junior at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.

I work at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Theory of Computation. Currently, I am involved in the development of the supporting code and the teaching materials (usually notebooks) for the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (which is often called The Bible of the field).

When I am not busy pondering over the questions that define human intelligence, I can be found shouting my throat out at the Dramatics Club IITR.

Besides all that, I am an NTSE scholar, Encore awardee and a KVPY fellow.

Hope you stick around for a while.
