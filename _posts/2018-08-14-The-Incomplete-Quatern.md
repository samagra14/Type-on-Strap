It all began when I was still too lame <br>
But was bright enough to refrain from a burning flame<br>
The urge to merge with the better self<br>
When my senses were still that of an elf<br>

My mind painted an elegant conception<br>
And my heart was filled with utter elation<br>
I was amazed by what my mind could portray<br>
I wished I could transform them into a monument of clay<br>

But, as time passed, I was introduced to the harsh reality<br>
Which submerged my heart into an ocean of pity<br>
The realisation of the loss of expression<br>
Of freedom, of faith and contemplation<br>

Drew over me as a havoc<br>
And threw me down from the hammock<br>
But my life changed forever<br>
When I first saw her......<br>

Her hair was the color of the wings of raven,<br>
Cascading like a waterfall down her waist;<br>
Her lips were the incarnation of the Elysium,<br>
Surrounded by mist, so pure so chaste<br>

She was a portrait of elegance,<br>
Personifying it with every moment that passed<br>
Inspiring the rains to cure the fields that were parched,<br>
To behold her beauty, giving nature its chance<br>
