<p>It all began when I was still too lame
But was bright enough to refrain from a burning flame
The urge to merge with the better self
When my senses were still that of an elf</p>

<p>My mind painted an elegant conception
And my heart was filled with utter elation
I was amazed by what my mind could portray
I wished I could transform them into a monument of clay</p>

<p>But, as time passed, I was introduced to the harsh reality
Which submerged my heart into an ocean of pity
The realisation of the loss of expression
Of freedom, of faith and contemplation</p>

<p>Drew over me as a havoc
And threw me down from the hammock
But my life changed forever
When I first saw her……</p>

<p>Her hair was the color of the wings of raven,
Cascading like a waterfall down her waist;
Her lips were the incarnation of the Elysium,
Surrounded by mist, so pure so chaste</p>

<p>She was a portrait of elegance,
Personifying it with every moment that passed
Inspiring the rains to cure the fields that were parched,
To behold her beauty, giving nature its chance</p>
